# dot_vim
My vim config

## Installation
### Manual installation
This repository is prepared to be used together with gnu stow. See [Brandon Invergo's
explanation](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html)
on how to use it. In short

```
mkdir ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
git clone https://github.com/fmauch/dot_vim.git
stow dot_vim
```

This will create symlinks for the dotfiles specified in ```dot_vim``` relative to your home folder.

After the package is cloned simply open up vim. Installation of plugins should automatically start
on first run. Note: There might be packages needed to be installed for all plugins to work properly
and there might be fields specifically setup for my machine so it's definitely worth it looking at
the configuration files.

### Install plugins and setup vim.coc
The config is structured as such that it will install all vim plugins when vim is opened for the first
time. However, to configure coc.vim, one has to install the necessary extensions by calling

```
:CocInstall coc-clangd coc-jedi
```

For a list of available extensions, please see
[here](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Using-coc-extensions#implemented-coc-extensions).

### Automatic installation
I personally use a shell script to install all my dotfiles at once that clones multiple repositories
and calls stow on them. You find it in my [dotfiles repository](https://github.com/fmauch/dotfiles).
The installation would then be

```
cd
git clone https://github.com/fmauch/dotfiles
cd dotfiles
# You might want to have a look at this to see which modules this will pull.
./install.sh
```
